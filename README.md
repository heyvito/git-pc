# git-pc

**Pretty Commit: a simple wrapper to make Git commit trailers easier.**

## Overview

`git-pc` is a lightweight Bash wrapper around `git commit` that helps you include structured metadata in your commits using [Git trailers](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers). It streamlines the process of adding commit types, optional categories, and breaking change indicators without cluttering your commit summary.

## Features

- Specify commit type with flags like `--feat`, `--fix`, `--chore`, etc.
- Optionally provide a category for the type.
- Mark commits as breaking changes with `--breaking`.
- Pass all standard `git commit` options transparently.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyvito/git-pc.git
cd git-pc
```

2. Copy `git-pc` to a directory in your `PATH`, for example:

```bash
sudo cp git-pc /usr/local/bin/
```

3. Ensure it is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-pc
```

Once installed, you can invoke it as:

```bash
git pc [options]
```

Git automatically resolves `git pc` to `git-pc` if the script is in your `PATH`.

## Usage

### Basic examples

Commit with a type:

```bash
git pc --feat -m "Add user login endpoint"
```

Commit with type and category:

```bash
git pc --feat auth -m "Support JWT tokens"
```

Commit marking a breaking change:

```bash
git pc --feat auth --breaking -m "Refactor token validation flow"
```

### Resulting commit trailers

Running:

```bash
git pc --feat "Tokenizer" --breaking "Tokenizer may do a backflip" -m "Allow tokenizer to do a backflip"
```

Produces a commit like:

```
Allow tokenizer to do a backflip

Type: feat
Scope: Tokenizer
Breaking: Tokenizer may do a backflip
```

Empty `breaking` arguments results in a `Breaking: true` trailer:

```bash
git pc --feat "Tokenizer" --breaking -m "Allow tokenizer to do a backflip"
```

Produces instead a commit like:

```
Allow tokenizer to do a backflip

Type: feat
Scope: Tokenizer
Breaking: true
```

Trailers can be parsed with:

```bash
git log -1 --pretty=format:"%B" | git interpret-trailers --parse
```

## Supported flags

- `--feat [scope]`
- `--fix [scope]`
- `--chore [scope]`
- `--build [scope]`
- `--ci [scope]`
- `--docs [scope]`
- `--style [scope]`
- `--refactor [scope]` or `--refac [scope]`
- `--perf [scope]`
- `--test` or `--spec [scope]`
- `--breaking [reason]`

Any other arguments are passed directly to `git commit`.

## Why?

Conventional commit prefixes in messages are useful for automated tools, but Git trailers provide a structured and parseable alternative without cluttering your commit summary. This script was inspired by [Sarah Matheyâ€™s post](https://srazkvt.codeberg.page/posts/2025-07-06-conventional-commits-makes-me-sad.html) highlighting these ideas. A blog post about reasoning is also available [on my blog](https://vito.io/articles/2025-07-07-a-better-conventional-commit.html).
